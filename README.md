Created by me and movblock. Huge thanks to mov for helping a lot to kickstart this addon!<br>
Developed mostly alone, so the mod's highly unstable. Not recommended to use on servers, but you can if you want to.

It adds exclusive features such as DFC rework, RBMK-like PWRs, the LFTR, and countless smaller features such as nuclear explosion VFX and SFX, more control panel support, rad classification, and more.


### Notes

The addon lacks an in-game version number system, so make sure you check on new releases every time you play!
